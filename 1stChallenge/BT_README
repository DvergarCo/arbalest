Bluetooth may not work voluntarily. So, here are the steps to make it work.

Try: 
> sdptool browse local

if it fails, do this:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You need to run the blue tooth daemon in compatibility mode to provide deprecated command line interfaces. You're running Bluez5 and you need some Bluez4 functions. You can do this by editing this file

/etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.bluez.service

and changing this line

ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd

to this

ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --compat

and then restarting bluetooth like this

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth

and you'll also have to change permissions on /var/run/sdp

sudo chmod 777 /var/run/sdp
--------------------------------------------------

Then you need to add bluetooth serial port services. Thats done so:
> sdptool add --channel=22 SP

You can check whether you are successful or not by running sdp browse local again.

Then the python code should work.

If not, you might need to install pip and libbluetooth-dev
> sudo apt-get install python-pip libbluetooth-dev
then
> pip install pybluez
and now it should work.

For the android side, this app is good:
